# Ready-Weather-Or-Not

## Purpose

A five day weather forecaster

When the user is given a weather dashboard with form inputs, they are able to search for a city. They are then presented with current and future conditions for that city and taht city is added to the searech history.  When the current weather conditions for that city are viewed, the user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. The user may view a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity when they select the future weather conditions for that city. The user may click on the city in the search history and are then again presented with current and future conditions for that city. This was all achieved in JavaScript through the use of the OpenWeather API.
